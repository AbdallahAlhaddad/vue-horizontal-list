# vue-horizontal-list
A pure vue horizontal list implementation with ssr, mobile, touch screen support.
I created this because I like how AirBnb does their horizontal list, I couldn't find a library that is close to it.
Check out [slick](https://github.com/kenwheeler/slick) if you need a complete solution.
